 *         The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series
 *         of n daily price quotes for a stock and we need to calculate the span
 *         of stock’s price for all n days. The span Si of the stock’s price on
 *         a given day i is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days
 *         just before the given day, for which the price of the stock on the
 *         current day is less than or equal to its price on the given day. For
 *         example, if an array of 7 days prices is given as {100, 80, 60, 70,
 *         60, 75, 85}, then the span values for corresponding 7 days are {1, 1,
 *         1, 2, 1, 4, 6}.
